# DaalBot API
The DaalBot API is well an API for interacting with DaalBot, It is currently accessible at api.daalbot.xyz.

## Documentation
Documentation for the API is stored on the docs site ([docs.daalbot.xyz](https://docs.daalbot.xyz)), It may be incomplete in spots but basic data such as route path is available.

## Contributing
Well thank you for the consideration of contributing to DaalBot's API while this API isnt built with self hosting in mind you can setup just enough data to get the API running if you read the code.

All authentication is stored client side but checked on the server using hashes in `data/auth.json`. Setting up dev environments will hopefully be made easier in the future however that is not currently the highest priority.
